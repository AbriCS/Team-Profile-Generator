## Description

This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## Installation

- open terminal
- clone the repo: `https://github.com/AbriCS/Team-Profile-Generator`
- enter 'cd' to move to a new directory
- download JSON packages by entering `npm i`

- follow each prompt

## Usage

This is a command-line application that takes the user input to create a HTML file. 

When a user clicks on an email address in the HTML then the default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address. 

When a user click on the GitHub username then that GitHub profile opens in a new tab. 

When the user starts the application then they are prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.

Next the user is presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building their team. 

If they select the engineer option, then they are prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username.

When they select the intern option, they are prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and then taken back to the menu.

When they finish building their team, then they exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
